# Financial Management Application (demo)

I developed this application to serve as an alternative to Quicken for recording and analyzing my personal finances. The application was never meant to be distributed for others to use, but I wanted to create this demo to convey its overall functionality. All records and personal information have been replaced with dummy records for preview purposes only.

The dashboard is hosted live at https://dennisarnold.shinyapps.io/Financial_Management_Application_Demo/

More details to come in the near future...
